No. The provided answer is 0.7. Where does 0.7 come from? Maybe a=50, b=? |50-b|=17 -> b=33 or b=67 (not in B). Maybe a=30, b=? |30-b|=17 -> b=13 (min(1.0, 0.1)=0.1) or b=47 (not in B).

There seems to be an issue with the question or the accepted answer. Let's assume a pair resulted in 0.7. Perhaps (50, ?) and B had an element near 33 with high membership? Or (a=X, b=Y) where |X-Y|=17 and min(muA(X), muB(Y))=0.7. This could be a=50, b=some value with muB approx 0.7? Or a=some value with muA approx 0.7, b=some value? The only muA=0.7 is at a=50. If a=50, we need b such that |50-b|=17, so b=33. If there was an element near 33 in B with high membership, 0.7 could be possible. Given the discrete sets, 0.7 seems impossible to obtain for δ=17.
